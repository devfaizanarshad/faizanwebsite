## 🏃 FASTEST PATH TO LIVE SITE (15 minutes)

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub (5 min)**

Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
# 1. Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# 2. Add all files
git add .

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "Ready to deploy Survtyx portfolio"

# 4. Go to github.com and create new repository called "survytx"
# Then run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/survytx.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

✅ **Your code is now on GitHub!**

---

### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (5 min)**

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** → **"Continue with GitHub"**
3. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
4. Find your **"survytx"** repo → Click **"Import"**
5. Click **"Deploy"** (don't change anything, auto-detects Vite)
6. Wait 2 minutes... ⏳

✅ **YOUR SITE IS LIVE!** 🎉

You'll get a free URL like: `https://survytx-abc123.vercel.app`

**Test it immediately** - Share with friends, check on mobile!

### **Step 3: Add Custom Domain (5 min)**

#### **Option A: Buy Domain First**

**Cheapest Registrars:**
- **Porkbun.com** - $7-9/year for .com
- **Namecheap.com** - $8-12/year
- **Cloudflare Registrar** - $8/year (requires Cloudflare account)

1. Buy your domain (e.g., `survytx.com`)
2. In Vercel dashboard → **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Type your domain → Click **"Add"**
4. Vercel shows you 2 nameservers:
   ```
   ns1.vercel-dns.com
   ns2.vercel-dns.com
   ```
5. Go to your registrar (Porkbun/Namecheap)
6. Find **"Nameservers"** settings
7. Change to **"Custom Nameservers"**
8. Paste Vercel's nameservers
9. Save

⏰ **Wait 10-60 minutes for DNS to update**

✅ **Your site is now live at your custom domain!**

---

#### **Option B: Test First, Buy Domain Later**

Just use the free Vercel URL for now:
- `https://survytx-abc123.vercel.app`
- Buy domain when you're ready
- Add it later (same steps as above)

---

## 🔄 Update Your Site (Ongoing)

After initial deployment, updating is EASY:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes in VS Code

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Updated hero section"
git push

# 3. DONE! Auto-deploys in 30 seconds 🎉
```

Vercel automatically rebuilds on every Git push!
